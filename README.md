# Statistics beyond classical balanced designs -- the joy of mixed models

*Talk given to RIT's Data Science Research Group*

Many classic and classical statistical tests and analyses rely on assumptions about an idealized world with perfect balance and covariate control. Similarly, a lot of classic statistical software bakes these assumptions into more modern technique that don't require perfect balance. I will present a few examples of the types of real-world data that necessitate techniques and software that can handle imbalance and show how mixed-effects models using MixedModels.jl provide a fast and powerful tool for analyzing these data.
